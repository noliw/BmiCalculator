- [x] At least one (1) user input
- [x] At least one (1) interactive View
- [x] At least one (1) output of a calculation based on the user input

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

## Notes

During the development of the app, I learned how to create a simple 
and effective user interface using XML layouts in Android Studio. I also gained experience
in handling user input and performing calculations using Kotlin. Implementing the BMI calculation 
logic helped me understand how to work with user input validation and how to display the results in
a user-friendly manner. Throughout the project, I was able to explore best practices for code organization 
and readability, as well as how to use string interpolation for formatting output strings. This project served
as a valuable learning experience in Android app development.
